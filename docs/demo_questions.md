# Demo Structure & Questions

> This is a list of possible questions for the demo.  
> **We will not ask all of them**‚Äîthese are examples to help you understand what to expect.  
> The actual questions will depend on the project and the flow of the demo.  
>  
> **Please note:** There will actually be *fewer* questions asked during the demo. This list is just to help you prepare for the kinds of topics we might cover.
