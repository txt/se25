### Description


An introduction to software life cycle models; size estimation;
cost and schedule estimation; project management; risk management;
formal technical reviews; analysis, design, coding and testing
methods; configuration management and change control; and software
reliability estimation. Emphasis on large development projects. An
individual project required following good software engineering
practices throughout the semester.


### Prerequisites
CSC 316 and CSC 226 (or equivalent)


### Textbook
- Optional, purchase not necessary
  - [Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Ian-Sommerville/dp/0137053460/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
    9th International edition by Roger Pressman
- Available in paperback for $4.65 (the shipping costs are actually more than the book).


### Learning Outcomes


- Students will achieve a high level of expertise in  SE,
  mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to apply this 
  knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical research problems
- Students will apply sound development methods/tools to problems in  SE
  and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Students will analyze/interpret/implemeent software requirements
- Students will communicate their work clearly and professionally in both 
  written and oral forms appropriate to “SE"


### Class Discord Group
It is each student's responsibility to join the class Discord group "se24fall". 
Till Friday week1, the link to join there is [here](https://discord.gg/auBPXMnc).


All class communication from staff to students will be via this Discord group.


Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their questions and answers to that shared resource.
Note that, for communication of a more private nature, contact the lecturer on the email shown below.


### Assessment
Grades come from


- 3 projects
- 1 mid-session exam
- 5 homeworks (testing software guru skills)
- 1 final exam (for those that want to replace the mark on one of their mid-term and homework).
- 1 essay (due Dec4) on SE ethics. You will have all the materials for this exam by 
  mid-semester. Feel free to submit early.
- Exams and essays are done individually. Everything else is done in groups of 3.


Projects comprise large maintenance tasks where you have to extend someone else'e code 
(groups of 3 people, working in public Github repos-- not NCSU GH): 


- This will demonstrate the important of documentation, design purity, regression tests, etc.


Each project will generate "brag" documents that sell the project work in version _i_ 
for those who want to work in _i+1_.


- At the end of the semester, if group1 complete work boasted by another group2,
then group2 will receive one bonus mark.
- Project1: you review five projects done previsously in this subjects, 
select one, then boast of its accomplishments.
- Project2: you will switch projects and significantly extend some project
- Projects3: you will swtich to someone else's project2 code 


### Grades


|group	|mark|	notes|
|-------|----|-------|
|essay (solo)	|         20 | 3 bonus	for ethical brilliance|
|homework (5\*3)|       15| |
|mid-term exam (solo)	| 20| |
|project (group)|	      10+15+20	|project1,2,3|


Students are marked 0,1,2,3 for homeworks. If you get anything less than 3, you can resubmit (within 1 week)
and the new submission's mark will cancel out the first version).


Also, there is an optional final exam which students can attend if they want to replace 
their mid-term mark. Please note that if you get a lower mark on this final then your 
lowest mid-term mark will then decrease. Caveat Emptor.


With the final grades, the following grade scale will be used: 


     A+ (97-100),  A (93-97),   A-(90-92)
     B+ (87-89),   B (83-87),   B-(80-82)
     C+ (77-79),   C (73-77),   C-(70-72)
     D+ (67-69),   D (63-67),   D-(60-62)
     F (below 60).


### Late Marks


For the report, students will lose 2 marks per day for late submissions (weekend = 2 day).


For the homeworks, students will lose 1 marks per day for late submissions (weekend = 1 day).


Groups must post the homeworks each  week, even if it is incomplete, OR THEY WILL LOSE ONE MARK.  Those lost marks are never returned.


## Policies


### Preferred Method of Communication & Response Time


Nearly all the class communication from staff to students will be via this Discord group.


You should expect to receive a response within two business days (i.e. not over the weekend). 
- If I email/message you directly, please strive to respond within two business days.
- It is recommended that you check your NC State email at least once a day to stay on top of course communications.


If you have a question about the course or its content, you can email me or post your question on our discord
group. You can expect to receive a response within two business days (i.e. not over the weekend)


If you need to contact me directly, my preferred method of communication is
the discord group. However, for private matters, feel free to contact me via email.  
If emailing then:
- Always include a descriptive, specific but concise subject.
- Include your course number your email, and provide adequate context for your question in order to ensure full understanding of your email.
- Be sure to use your NC State email account, and sign in with your name and Student ID number.


### Expectations for learner participation and interaction


Course activities will require you to interact with other students in the course. 
For masters students, some evidence must be generated that you are actively engaged with your class peers. Specifically:


- The project repo MUST have a branch called "MAIN". Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in MAIN.
    Projects were all group members are not active doing commits will lose marks
    (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).
- Groups need to maintain an active discussion in the channel within the subject's Discord channel.
    Projects were all group members are not active in discussions  will either lose marks
    (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).


### Attendance


Lectures are twice a week. 
Lectures will be recorded.


Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. 


If, for a quiz, you must be absence for a reason sanction by the university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will be made.
Those sanctioned events are:


- The student is away from campus representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team.  These students would typically be accompanied by a University faculty or staff member.
- Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
- Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA) (go.ncsu.edu/absence). For more information about a variety of religious observances, visit the Diversity Calendar.
- Required military duty as certified by the student’s commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses for unanticipated absences must be reported to the instructor as soon as possible, but not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
  - Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
  - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.  An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (go.ncsu.edu/absence).


Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to
attend  mandatory office hours session.
There, students may be asked to review code,
concepts, or comment on the structure of the
course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to
attend will result in marks being deducted.


### Disabilities


Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable
disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations,
students must register with the [Disability Resource Office (DRO)](https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/)
For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students
with disabilities, please see the

- Respect cultural differences that may influence communication styles and needs.]


Any remark you make
in some on-line comment tracking system like Github
is a public document.
So take heed of the following cautionary tale.
One year, a student was joking around with
his buddy in a Github issue report. Then he was
rude enough and stupid enough to 
add a remark about how the rest of the
team was just so
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;.
Needless to say,
the rest of the team took great
offense at this remark and invoked the University's
non-discrimination policies. As a result, everyone
lost much time that semester, as well as grades. 


### Expected Workload
This is an _advanced graduate_ class at  R1 institution 
(an R1 institution is classified as a doctoral university with very high research activity). 


 Students must be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
lecture meeting). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject.


### Academic Integrity


Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the i
[Code of Student Conduct 11.35.01 sections 8 and 9](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01). 
Therefore, students are required to uphold the Pack Pledge: “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment.” i
Violations of academic integrity will be handled in accordance with the 
[Student Discipline Procedures](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/).


Please refer to the [Academic Integrity web page](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/) for a detailed explanation of the University’s policies on academic integrity and some of the common understandings related to those policies.


Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:


+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.


Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:


+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.


### Privacy


#### Student Privacy


- In-class sessions are recorded in such a way that might also record students in this course.
- These recordings MAY be used beyond the current semester or in any other setting outside of the course.
- Contact your instructor if you have concerns.


#### Class Privacy


Student information in this course may be accessible to persons
beyond the instructor and students in the course. This course may
involve electronic sharing or posting of personally identifiable
student work or other information with persons not taking or
administering the course. 


### Policy on Incomplete Grades


Information on incomplete grades can be found at 
[REG 02.50.03 – Grades and Grade Point Average](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03/). 
If you encounter a serious disruption to your work not caused by you and you would have otherwise successfully completed the course, contact your instructor as soon as you can to discuss the possibility of earning an incomplete in the course for the semester, including an agreement on when the remaining work must be done in order to change the grade to the appropriate letter grade.


If your  must withdraw from a course or from the University due to hardship beyond your control, see 
[Withdrawal Process and Timeline | Student Services Center](https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-classes/withdrawal/process/) for information and instructions.


### Syllabus Modification Statement


Our syllabus represents a flexible agreement. It outlines the topics we will cover and the order in which we will cover them. Dates for assignments represent the earliest possible time they would be due. The pace of the class depends on student mastery and interests. Thus minor changes in the syllabus can occur if we need to slow down or speed up the pace of instruction.
