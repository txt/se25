## Details


|What               | Notes |
|:------------------|:------|
|Course Credit Hours| 3     |
|Course website     | [https://github.com/txt/se25](https://github.com/txt/se25) |
|Catalog Description| An introduction to software life cycle models; size estimation; cost and schedule estimation; project management; risk management; formal technical reviews; analysis, design, coding and testing methods; configuration management and change control; and software reliability estimation. Emphasis on large development projects. A group project is required following good software engineering practices throughout the semester. |
|Textbook           | [Software Engineering: A Modern Approach](https://softengbook.org/)  |
|Structure          | The majority of this course is synchronous, delivered through real-time, face-to-face class sessions. |
|Instructions       | Learning activities in this course will include  five homeworks, 2 exams, three projects.|
|Tool used          | All grades will be recorded in Moodle.<br> All student work will be in Github (public GH, not the NCSU version).|
|Auditing           | not permitted |
|Attendance         | not mandatory |
|Technical requirements | A laptop computer is required for students taking this course.  NC State’s Online and Distance Education provides technology requirements and recommendations for computer hardware, and NC State’s Office of Information Technology provides recommendations for your computer . But as a rule-of-thumb, your computer is adequate if you can edit and run code using the  Github codespaces environment.|


 


 


### Learning Outcomes


- Students will achieve a high level of expertise in  SE, mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to apply this knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical research problems
- Students will apply sound development methods/tools to problems in  SE and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Students will analyze/interpret/implement software requirements
- Students will communicate their work clearly and professionally in both written and oral forms appropriate to “SE"
 


### Assessment
 
- 3 projects
- 1 mid-session exam
- 5 homeworks (testing software guru skills)
- 1 final exam (for those that want to replace the mark on one of their mid-term and homework).
- 1 essay  on SE ethics. 
- Exams and essays are done individually. Everything else is done in groups of 3.
  - Important note: while homeworks are done in groups of 3, you will be examined individually
    about that content. So make sure you understand **all** the homework material.


 


Projects comprise large maintenance tasks where you have to extend someone else'e code (groups of 3 people, working in public Github repos-- not NCSU GH): 


- This will demonstrate the important of documentation, design purity, regression tests, etc.


Each project will generate "brag" documents that sell the project work in version _i_ 
for those who want to work in _i+1_.


- Project1: 
  - You review ten projects done previously in this subjects elect two, then boast of its accomplishments.
  - Select wisely. You have a 25% chance that, in project2, you will have to work on your Project1 selections.
- Project2: 
  - You will switch projects and significantly extend some project
- Projects3: 
  - You will swtich to someone else's project2 code 


### Grades


|group	|mark|notes|
|-------|----|-----|
|essay (solo)	|         22 |  |
|homework (5\*1)|       5| Students are marked -1,0,1 for homeworks: -1 = no submission;  0 = needs fixing; 1 = passed. <br> Homeworks can be resubmitted twice, for up to 3 weeks after the first submission.  | 
|mid-term exam (solo)	| 25|  |
|3  projects (group)|	      10+15+23	| |
| final exam (optional) | 25| Also, there is an optional final exam which students can attend if they want to replace  their mid-term mark.<br> Please note that if you get a lower mark on this final then your  lowest mid-term mark will then decrease. <br>Caveat Emptor.|


With the final grades, the following grade scale will be used: 


     A+ (97-100),  A (93-97),   A-(90-92)
     B+ (87-89),   B (83-87),   B-(80-82)
     C+ (77-79),   C (73-77),   C-(70-72)
     D+ (67-69),   D (63-67),   D-(60-62)
     F (below 60).


### Late Marks


Submissions score one late mark per day (but only -1 for the weekend).


### Expectations for learner participation and interaction


Course activities will require you to interact with other students in the course. 
For masters students, some evidence must be generated that you are actively engaged with your class peers. Specifically:


- The project repo MUST have a branch called "MAIN". Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in MAIN.
    Projects were all group members are not active doing commits will lose marks (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).
- Groups need to maintain an active discussion in the channel within the subject's Discord channel. Projects were all group members are not active in discussions  will either lose marks    (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).


### Attendance


- Lectures are twice a week. 
- Lectures will be recorded.
- Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. 


If, for a quiz, you must be absence for a reason sanction by the university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will be made.
Those sanctioned events are:


- The student is away from campus representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team.  These students would typically be accompanied by a University faculty or staff member.
- Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
- Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA) (go.ncsu.edu/absence). For more information about a variety of religious observances, visit the Diversity Calendar.
- Required military duty as certified by the student’s commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses for unanticipated absences must be reported to the instructor as soon as possible, but not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
  - Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
  - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.   


Absence Verification: The [Absence Verification office](https://dasa.ncsu.edu/support-and-advocacy/find-help/absence-notification/) will provide student absence verifications for deaths, legal obligations, military duty, and serious illnesses like surgery and hospitalizations.  


Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend  mandatory office hours session.
There, students may be asked to review code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.


### Disabilities


Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable
disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations,
students must register with the [Disability Resource Office (DRO)](https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/)
For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students
with disabilities, please see the 
[Policies, Rules and Regulations page maintained by the DRO](https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/about-us/policies-rules-regulations/)
and [REG 02.20.01 Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/).


### Non-Discrimination Policy


All students at North Carolina State University (“NC State” or the “University”) are
responsible for conducting themselves in a manner that helps enhance an environment
of learning in which the rights, dignity, worth, and freedom of each member of the
academic community are respected.


NC State prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment based on a person’s protected status in University programs and activities. NC State also prohibits retaliation for any protected activity.

- Treat each community member with respect by not recording others without their consent or engaging in any form of hazing, harassment, intimidation, or abuse.
- Respect cultural differences that may influence communication styles and needs.]


### Academic Integrity


Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the i
[What is Academic Misconduct?](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/).
Therefore, students are required to uphold the Pack Pledge: 
" “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment,” on all syllabi, assignments, examinations, or other academic evaluations is encouraged."


Cheating will be punished to [the full extent possible](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-misconduct/). 
Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:


+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.


Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:


+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.


#### Student Privacy


- In-class sessions are recorded in such a way that might also record students in this course.
- These recordings MAY be used beyond the current semester or in any other setting outside of the course.
- Contact your instructor if you have concerns.


### Syllabus Modification Statement


Our syllabus represents a flexible agreement. It outlines the topics we will cover and the order in which we will cover them. Dates for assignments represent the earliest possible time they would be due. The pace of the class depends on student mastery and interests. Thus minor changes in the syllabus can occur if we need to slow down or speed up the pace of instruction.
