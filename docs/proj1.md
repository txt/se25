# Project1: Set Goals for Project2


<br clear=all>


Your task: look at the past, sell a possible future.


What to hand-in: two posters from two projects that describe


- what was done before
- what could be done to extend that


Improtant:


- look at 10+ projects before picking two
- cause you have a 25% chance of acually having to do one of these posters for project2.
- So be critical. Many prior projects are less than perfect (poor install instructions, packages that no longer install, dull goals)


## Rubric for posters


Each poster:


- Is a standard page size
- Uses very small fonts ( text may be as small as 4 to 6 point)
- Is a pdf file
- Does  not have vast amounts of white space
- Has 
  - a screen snaps of the running system; 
  - has a  url/QR code to the repo; 
  - optionally (but preferred) has a url/QR code to a live demo (and how you host that demo is up to you).
- Sells the software:
  - i.e. up to  5  ways that this software (Version i) is better than what was true BEFORE this software was written
- Proposes a better version for version i+1
  - 3 to five implementation milestones, each of which  takes version i+1 to a better place
  - Note that these milestones have to demonstrate a possible implementation plan, with clear goals.
  - Perhaps some milestones will be explored in parallel.
- Boasts your number of test cases (one group listed 130+, which is really cool since that means you can  make new changes to the system while checking if the old stuff still works)


## Ways to lose points:


- Your poster does not have the above features.
- Your poster fails to sell. Specifically:
  - in the first 15 seconds or reading, the poster offers  does not  very clear understanding of what was going on (so good intro sentence)
  - the  poster does not  make a case that this technology stack is interesting (e.g. "select this project so you can
    learn about kubernetes")


## How to fail at this project


- Start late, looking at the corpus.
- Write posters for dull projects
