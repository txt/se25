# Project1: Set Goals for Project2
 


## Your Task


**Look at the past, sell a possible future.**


### What to Hand In
Two posters and two "video demos" from two projects that describe:
1. **What was done before**
2. **What could be done to extend that**
 
### Important


- Review **9+ projects** before selecting two.
- You have a **25% chance** of having to create one of these posters for Project2, so choose carefully.
- Many previous projects may have issues (e.g., poor installation instructions, outdated packages, dull goals). Be critical in your selection.


---


## Rubric 


### Each "video demo":
1. Be no more than **5 minutes long**.
2. Include the following:
   - A **running program** with demonstrated functionality.
   - An explanation of **why you want to work on this project**.
   - A discussion of **what changes or updates** could be made.
  
**Please note:** You are required to record two videos and either attach the videos directly to Moodle or include links to them within the your PDF file. The tutor will review the submitted posters and videos independently, without interacting with the students during the review process.


### Each poster must:


1. Be a **standard page size** (e.g., letter or A4).
2. Use **small fonts** (text may be as small as 4 to 6 points).
3. Be submitted as a **PDF file**.
4. Avoid vast amounts of **white space**.


#### Include the Following:


- **Screenshots** of the running system.
- **URLs/QR codes**:
  - To the repository.
  - To a "canned video" (how you host the demo is up to you).
- **Sell the software**:
  - Highlight **up to 5 ways** Version *i* is better than what was true BEFORE this software was written.
- **Propose a better version (Version i+1)**:
  - Include **3â€“5 implementation milestones** to improve Version i+1.
  - Note that these milestones have to demonstrate a possible implementation plan, with clear goals.
  - Perhaps some milestones will be explored in parallel.
- **Boast your test cases**:
  - E.g., "One group listed 130+ test cases, showcasing their ability to make changes while maintaining old functionality."


---


## Grading


- **Video demo 1:** 2.5 marks
- **Poster 1:** 2.5 marks
- **Video demo 2:** 2.5 marks
- **Poster 2:** 2.5 marks


## Ways to lose points:


- Your poster or "video demo" does not have the above features.
- Your poster fails to effectively **sell** the project. Specifically:
  - in the first 15 seconds or reading, the poster offers  does not  very clear understanding of what was going on (so good intro sentence)
  - the  poster does not  make a case that this technology stack is interesting (e.g. "select this project so you can
    learn about kubernetes")
---


## How to fail at this project


- Starting late when reviewing the project corpus.
- Choosing dull projects for your posters.
