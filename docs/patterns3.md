## Pattern Evolution


### üï∞Ô∏è **Then: LAMP & MEAN (Classic Layered Architectures)**


- **LAMP**: Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP
  ‚Üí Server-rendered HTML, monolithic backend logic.


- **MEAN**: MongoDB + Express.js + Angular + Node.js
  ‚Üí Full-stack JavaScript with clear frontend/backend split.


These were **layered** in the sense that the stack flowed cleanly from data to presentation.


### üöÄ **Now: What We Do in 2025**


Today‚Äôs web architecture is more **modular**, **decoupled**, and **scalable** ‚Äî built to handle real-time apps, mobile, cloud, and performance at scale.


So the big shift today is **decoupling**:
- APIs instead of direct DB calls
- Serverless instead of always-on backend
- Micro-frontends instead of big frontend apps
- Static-first with dynamic "sprinkles"


Here are some of  major patterns in practice:


### ‚úÖ **1. Jamstack (Static + API-First + Pre-rendering)**
**Stack**: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup
**Tools**: Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo, Netlify, Vercel
**Why**: Speed, CDN-first delivery, scalability
**Architecture**: Pre-rendered content + dynamic behavior via API calls
**Pattern**: Closest to Microservices + Event-Driven


### ‚úÖ **2. Serverless Architectures**
**Stack**: Frontend + Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)
**Tools**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers
**Why**: Auto-scaling, cost-efficient, no server management
**Architecture**: Business logic broken into tiny on-demand functions
**Pattern**: Microservices + Event-Driven + Pipe-Filter


### ‚úÖ **3. Micro-Frontend Architectures**
**Stack**: Independent UI components managed and deployed separately
**Tools**: Module Federation (Webpack 5), Single-SPA, Nx
**Why**: Large teams, decoupled frontend deployment
**Architecture**: Frontend mimics microservices structure
**Pattern**: Microservices at the browser level


### ‚úÖ **4. Edge Computing & CDN-Backed Logic**
**Stack**: Cloudflare, Fastly, Vercel Edge
**Why**: Ultra-low latency, regionalized logic
**Architecture**: Push logic and data caching close to the user
**Pattern**: Space-Based (or Distributed Memory)


### ‚úÖ **5. Hybrid Rendering (SSR + CSR + ISR)**
**Tools**: Next.js, Nuxt
**Why**: Flexibility ‚Äî SEO + speed + dynamic updates
**Architecture**: Combines pre-rendered static content with dynamic server-side rendering
**Pattern**: Modern take on Layered, but with JAM+Serverless flavor


### Summary Table


| Old Stack | Modern Equivalent           | Key Architectural Shift                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| LAMP      | Jamstack + Serverless       | From server-rendered to API + static site |
| MEAN      | Microservices + Serverless  | From monolith to decoupled services       |
| MVC       | Micro-Frontends             | From unified frontend to modular UI       |
