# More Patterns

##  Standard Patterns

### ‚úÖ **1. Layered Architecture Pattern**
**Definition:** A traditional n-tier model (e.g., presentation, business, persistence, database). Each layer has a distinct responsibility.
**Example:** An eCommerce web app with separate logic for UI, business rules, and data access.
**Use When:** You want simplicity, separation of concerns, and maintainability‚Äîespecially good for teams with limited architectural experience.
**Potential Merge:** Related to Client-Server due to the tiered communication, but distinct in layer enforcement.


### ‚úÖ **2. Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**
**Definition:** Components (event processors) asynchronously communicate through events.
**Example:** E-commerce sites reacting to user interactions (e.g., order placed ‚Üí inventory updated ‚Üí shipping triggered).
**Use When:** Asynchronous, decoupled, real-time interaction is important.
**Potential Merge:** Shares traits with Microservices (especially in event orchestration), but is broader in scope.


### ‚úÖ **3. Microkernel Architecture Pattern**
**Definition:** A minimal core system with plug-in modules to add functionality.
**Example:** A task scheduler where the microkernel handles scheduling, and plug-ins define specific tasks.
**Use When:** Systems need a stable core and evolving peripheral features.
**Potential Merge:** Conceptually overlaps with Microservices in terms of modularity, but with a stronger emphasis on a single extensible platform.


### ‚úÖ **4. Microservices Architecture Pattern**
**Definition:** Small, independently deployable services focused on specific business functionality.
**Example:** Netflix‚Äîhundreds of independent services for playback, recommendations, billing, etc.
**Use When:** You need scalability, decentralized development, or rapid iteration.
**Potential Merge:** Often paired with Event-Driven and shares modularity with Microkernel.

### ‚úÖ **5. Space-Based Architecture Pattern**
**Definition:** Built around the concept of **tuple space** (distributed shared memory). Consists of processing units and a middleware managing data and requests.
**Example:** Online auction systems that must handle concurrency and high loads.
**Use When:** You expect high volume, high concurrency, and scaling challenges.
**Better Name?** Consider **‚ÄúDistributed Memory Pattern‚Äù**, **‚ÄúGrid-Based Architecture‚Äù**, or **‚ÄúScalable Cache-Based Architecture‚Äù** to better reflect the mechanism and purpose.


### ‚úÖ **6. Client-Server Pattern**
**Definition:** The client requests services from a centralized server.
**Example:** Email services, web browsers connecting to web servers.
**Use When:** You need centralized control with distributed access.
**Potential Merge:** Shares structural similarities with Layered Pattern but focuses on runtime interaction, not strict tier separation.


### ‚úÖ **7. Master-Slave Pattern**
**Definition:** Master divides work among slaves, which execute in parallel and report back.
**Example:** Database replication, parallel computation (e.g., matrix operations).
**Use When:** You need high performance via task parallelism.
**Potential Merge:** Somewhat overlaps with Pipe-Filter in linear processing, but Pipe-Filter is more about data transformation than parallel task delegation.


### ‚úÖ **8. Pipe-Filter Pattern**
**Definition:** Data is transformed sequentially through a chain of filters.
**Example:** Compilers (lexing ‚Üí parsing ‚Üí optimization ‚Üí code generation).
**Use When:** You need modular, stream-based data processing (ETL pipelines, Unix shell).
**Potential Merge:** None directly, though visually and architecturally resembles chained microservices or event flows.


### üß© Patterns That Could Be Merged or Grouped
| Merge Suggestion | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| **Layered + Client-Server** | Both follow a logical separation of responsibilities and hierarchical communication. |
| **Microkernel + Microservices** | Both emphasize modularity and extensibility, but Microkernel is platform-centric. |
| **Microservices + Event-Driven** | Commonly co-used: event-driven infrastructure supports decoupled microservices. |
| **Pipe-Filter + Master-Slave** | Can resemble each other in some data processing systems, but differ in control flow and purpose. |

## Applying Patterns To  Edge Computing


### üåê **Edge Computing (Definition)**

**Edge computing** is a distributed computing model where **data processing and storage occur close to the physical location** where it's generated ‚Äî such as on devices, local servers, or edge data centers ‚Äî instead of relying solely on a central cloud.

Think of edge computing as "bringing the cloud closer to where the action happens.


### üß† Why It Matters

The goal of edge computing is to:
- **Reduce latency** (faster response times)
- **Save bandwidth** (less data sent to the cloud)
- **Increase reliability** (local fallback when network is slow or offline)
- **Enable real-time processing** (critical for things like autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, etc.)


### üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Cases
| Use Case                | How Edge Helps                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-driving cars**   | Process sensor data instantly to make driving decisions. |
| **Smart cameras**       | Analyze video locally for motion or face detection.     |
| **Retail stores**       | Track inventory and customer behavior in real time.     |
| **Industrial IoT**      | Monitor and react to factory machinery conditions.      |


### üìç Edge vs. Cloud

| Feature       | Edge Computing                 | Cloud Computing              |
|---------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Location**  | Near the data source           | Centralized data centers     |
| **Latency**   | Very low                       | Higher                       |
| **Reliability** | High (local fallback possible) | Depends on internet         |
| **Cost**      | Saves on bandwidth costs       | May incur ongoing network costs |


### üîç Where Edge Computing Fits Among the 8 Patterns

| Pattern               | Can it be used with Edge? | Why / How                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layered**           | üö´ Rarely                  | Typically central-server-based; not edge-optimized.         |
| **Event-Driven**      | ‚úÖ Absolutely              | Edge nodes can emit/respond to events (e.g., IoT triggers). |
| **Microkernel**       | ü§è Occasionally           | Edge plug-ins are possible but less common.                 |
| **Microservices**     | ‚úÖ Frequently              | Microservices can run at edge nodes for localization.       |
| **Space-Based**       | ‚úÖ Naturally               | Distributed memory/grid systems are well-suited to the edge.|
| **Client-Server**     | üö´ Not directly            | Server is centralized; client is passive.                   |
| **Master-Slave**      | ü§è Rarely                 | Edge use is limited unless slaves are deployed edge-side.   |
| **Pipe-Filter**       | ‚úÖ Sometimes               | Filters could run on edge devices (e.g., streaming pipelines).|


### üîß Best Fit Patterns for Edge Computing

1. **Space-Based** ‚Äî because it‚Äôs inherently about distributing processing and storage across nodes, which aligns closely with edge/CDN strategies.
2. **Event-Driven** ‚Äî since edge devices often react to local events (e.g., sensors, users).
3. **Microservices** ‚Äî due to the loosely-coupled nature of services that can be deployed selectively on the edge.

## Some Pattern Evolution

### üï∞Ô∏è **Then: LAMP & MEAN (Classic Layered Architectures)**


- **LAMP**: Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP
  ‚Üí Server-rendered HTML, monolithic backend logic.


- **MEAN**: MongoDB + Express.js + Angular + Node.js
  ‚Üí Full-stack JavaScript with clear frontend/backend split.


These were **layered** in the sense that the stack flowed cleanly from data to presentation.


### üöÄ **Now: What We Do in 2025**


Today‚Äôs web architecture is more **modular**, **decoupled**, and **scalable** ‚Äî built to handle real-time apps, mobile, cloud, and performance at scale.


So the big shift today is **decoupling**:
- APIs instead of direct DB calls
- Serverless instead of always-on backend
- Micro-frontends instead of big frontend apps
- Static-first with dynamic "sprinkles"


Here are some of  major patterns in practice:


### ‚úÖ **1. Jamstack (Static + API-First + Pre-rendering)**
**Stack**: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup
**Tools**: Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo, Netlify, Vercel
**Why**: Speed, CDN-first delivery, scalability
**Architecture**: Pre-rendered content + dynamic behavior via API calls
**Pattern**: Closest to Microservices + Event-Driven


### ‚úÖ **2. Serverless Architectures**
**Stack**: Frontend + Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)
**Tools**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers
**Why**: Auto-scaling, cost-efficient, no server management
**Architecture**: Business logic broken into tiny on-demand functions
**Pattern**: Microservices + Event-Driven + Pipe-Filter


### ‚úÖ **3. Micro-Frontend Architectures**
**Stack**: Independent UI components managed and deployed separately
**Tools**: Module Federation (Webpack 5), Single-SPA, Nx
**Why**: Large teams, decoupled frontend deployment
**Architecture**: Frontend mimics microservices structure
**Pattern**: Microservices at the browser level


### ‚úÖ **4. Edge Computing & CDN-Backed Logic**
**Stack**: Cloudflare, Fastly, Vercel Edge
**Why**: Ultra-low latency, regionalized logic
**Architecture**: Push logic and data caching close to the user
**Pattern**: Space-Based (or Distributed Memory)


### ‚úÖ **5. Hybrid Rendering (SSR + CSR + ISR)**
**Tools**: Next.js, Nuxt
**Why**: Flexibility ‚Äî SEO + speed + dynamic updates
**Architecture**: Combines pre-rendered static content with dynamic server-side rendering
**Pattern**: Modern take on Layered, but with JAM+Serverless flavor


### Summary Table


| Old Stack | Modern Equivalent           | Key Architectural Shift                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| LAMP      | Jamstack + Serverless       | From server-rendered to API + static site |
| MEAN      | Microservices + Serverless  | From monolith to decoupled services       |
| MVC       | Micro-Frontends             | From unified frontend to modular UI       |
