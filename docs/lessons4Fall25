- for projects with AI. extensive test suites
- project: new ideas.  project1: check the posters see what we ahve in side. some of the old project out dated
  - they dont need a new feature
  - need to be rewritten

- combine hw 1 + 2

- no hw2 but hw2 refactoring

- for project with AI
  - need better testing

- need to write somewhere, minimal test cases, test coverage. 
  - unit tests are fine
  - but need high level system cases. e.g. some stiry where auto labelling our sentiment, 
    need semantics compared against a ground truth

- some add things without fixing underlying things
  - e.g. 

- need to rewuite extensive rewerite AND a najor enhancement.

- we require some improvement
  - we see a solid description of before and after. 

- students want to see handover meeting

- for project 2 and 3 all programs should be deployed? https://vcl.ncsu.edu/scheduling/index.php?mode=selectauth
- add to proj 1,2,3 descriptions that milestones that they suggest should be implemented in a next step (for proj 2, 3)
- each HW should have no less than prewiouse one and add each time (readme, badges, CC, lisences etc) 
- it is confusing for students that they have deadlines till 11:25 am not 11:59 pm
- tell them to use the groups we set up for them in discord
- create am instruction with group assignment rules, deadlines, forms
- lectures really divide into
  - why, why not (ethics)
    - would you be ashamed if the new york times told the world what you are doing?
  - when, where (process)
  - who, how (resources)
  - what (product)
  - then there re internal and external metrics.
