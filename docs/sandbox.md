 Why | How (Process) | What (Resources) | Metrics |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.** | \- **Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities during development. \- **Conduct Threat Modeling:** Perform threat modeling sessions during the design phase to anticipate potential security threats and design countermeasures. \- **Perform Secure Code Reviews:** Establish a process for regular peer reviews focusing on security aspects of the code. | \- SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx). \- Threat modeling frameworks (e.g., OWASP Threat Dragon). \- Secure coding guidelines and checklists. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Number of vulnerabilities detected and resolved during development. \- Percentage of codebase covered by SAST scans. \- Frequency and effectiveness of threat modeling sessions. \- **External Metrics:** \- Reduction in security incidents post-deployment. \- Compliance with industry security standards and regulations. |
| **To ensure secure management of third-party components and dependencies.** | \- **Implement Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. \- **Maintain an Updated Inventory:** Keep an up-to-date inventory of all third-party components used in the project. \- **Establish Vendor Assessment Procedures:** Evaluate the security practices of third-party vendors before integration. | \- Dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk). \- Inventory management systems. \- Vendor assessment frameworks and questionnaires. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Number of vulnerabilities identified in dependencies. \- Time taken to update or patch vulnerable components. \- Percentage of third-party components with known vulnerabilities. \- **External Metrics:** \- Compliance with supply chain security requirements. \- Feedback from security audits regarding third-party component management. |
| **To detect and prevent malicious commits in the codebase.** | \- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all code repository accesses to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes. \- **Enforce Code Signing:** Mandate that all commits are signed with verified cryptographic keys to ensure authenticity. \- **Conduct Regular Audits:** Perform periodic audits of commit histories to identify and investigate suspicious activities. | \- MFA tools (e.g., hardware tokens, authenticator apps). \- GPG or SSH keys for commit signing. \- Audit logging systems integrated with version control platforms. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Number of unsigned or improperly signed commits detected. \- Frequency of unauthorized access attempts to repositories. \- Time taken to detect and respond to suspicious commit activities. \- **External Metrics:** \- Reduction in security breaches due to compromised code. \- Increased stakeholder confidence in code integrity. |
| **To secure the build and deployment infrastructure against potential threats.** | \- **Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and manage infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and enable automated security checks. \- **Enforce Access Controls:** Restrict access to build and deployment systems based on the principle of least privilege. \- **Conduct Regular Security Assessments:** Perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on the build and deployment pipelines. | \- IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible). \- Role-based access control (RBAC) systems. \- Security assessment tools and services. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated in the build pipeline. \- Frequency of access control policy violations. \- Time taken to deploy security patches to infrastructure. \- **External Metrics:** \- Compliance with deployment security standards. \- Reduction in incidents related to deployment infrastructure. |
| **To reduce entire classes of vulnerabilities at scale.** | \- **Adopt Safer Programming Languages:** Transition to programming languages that inherently reduce certain types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Rust for memory safety). \- **Mandate Secure Coding Frameworks:** Require the use of frameworks and libraries that enforce security best practices. \- **Provide Developer Training:** Offer regular training sessions focused on secure coding practices and common vulnerability mitigation. | \- Resources for learning and adopting safer programming languages. \- Secure coding frameworks and libraries. \- Training materials and programs on secure coding. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Reduction in the number of specific vulnerability types (e.g., buffer overflows) in the codebase. \- Percentage of developers who have completed security training. \- Adoption rate of secure coding frameworks. \- **External Metrics:** \- Decrease in security incidents reported by end-users. \- Improved compliance with security certifications and standards. |
| **To foster a company culture conducive to securing the software supply chain.** | \- **Establish Security Champions:** Designate team members as security advocates to promote best practices within development teams. \- **Incentivize Secure Development:** Implement reward systems for teams that consistently adhere to security protocols. \- **Encourage Open Communication:** Create channels for employees to report security concerns without fear of retribution. | \- Security training programs and workshops. \- Communication platforms for reporting and discussing security issues. \- Recognition and reward systems for secure development practices. | \- **Internal Metrics:** \- Employee participation rates in security programs. \- Number of security issues reported internally. \- Frequency of security-related discussions in team meetings. \- **External Metrics:** \- Enhanced reputation for security among clients and partners. \- Reduction in security incidents originating from internal practices. |
