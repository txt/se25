# Review Questions

1. **What is the definition of code refactoring, and how does it differ from adding new features or fixing bugs?**

2. **Why must behavior be preserved during refactoring? How can developers ensure this?**

3. **List and explain three common motivations for applying the Extract Method refactoring.**

4. **When is it appropriate to use the Inline Method refactoring instead of Extract Method?**

5. **How does the Move Method refactoring improve cohesion and reduce coupling? Provide an example scenario.**

6. **What does the Extract Class refactoring address, and how does it enhance modularity and reuse?**

7. **What are "code smells"? Give examples of smells that might suggest refactoring is needed.**

8. **How can automated tools and IDEs assist with refactoring, and what are their limitations?**

9. **Why is testing essential for safe refactoring? What kind of tests provide the most confidence?**

10. **What are some challenges in determining whether a refactoring is safe? Can this process be fully automated?**
