## Questions and Answers


**Why behavior must be preserved during refactoring? How can
developers ensure this?**


Behavior must be preserved because refactoring aims to improve the
internal structure of the code (modularity, design, readability,
testability) without altering its external functionality. Developers
can ensure this by focusing on code equivalence and relying on
invariants of the transformations being applied. The system should
work the same after refactoring as it did before.


**What are "code smells"? Give examples of smells that might suggest
refactoring is needed.**


Code smells are indicators of potential problems in the code that
suggest refactoring may be needed. The PDF does not give an explicit
definition of code smells or examples.


**Why is testing essential for safe refactoring? What kind of tests
provide the most confidence?**


Testing is essential for safe refactoring because it helps to ensure
that the refactoring process does not introduce any unintended
changes in behavior. Automated tests, in general, are the most
effective.

*   **Q1**: All student responses correctly stated that refactoring
is about maintaining external functionality while improving internal
code.


*   **Q2**: All student responses correctly identified "code smells"
as indicators of potential problems suggesting a need for refactoring


*   **Q3**: All student responses correctly stated testing is
essential for safe refactoring and mentioned testing to ensure code
functionality remains intact despite structural changes.


Based on the 100% correct response rate across all questions,
students demonstrated a good understanding of the fundamental
concepts of refactoring, code smells, and the importance of testing
for safe refactoring.
