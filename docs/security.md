# Security 101


| Why | How (Process) | What (Resources) | Metrics |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.** | \- **Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities during development. <br>\- **Conduct Threat Modeling:** Perform threat modeling sessions during the design phase to anticipate potential security threats and design countermeasures. <br>\-- **Perform Secure Code Reviews:** Establish a process for regular peer reviews focusing on security aspects of the code. |<br> \- SAST tools (e.g., [SonarQube](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-sonarqube-integration/sonarqube-dashboard.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=847&dpr=2), Checkmarx).<br> \- Threat modeling frameworks (e.g., [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://christian-schneider.net/slides/DEF-CON-2020-Threagile.pdf)).<br> \- Secure coding guidelines and checklists. |<br> **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Number of vulnerabilities detected and resolved during development.<br> \- Percentage of codebase covered by SAST scans.<br> \- Frequency and effectiveness of threat modeling sessions.<hr> **External Metrics:**<br> \- Reduction in security incidents post-deployment.<br> \- Compliance with industry security standards and regulations. |
| **To ensure secure management of third-party components and dependencies.** |<br> \- **Implement Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.<br> \- **Maintain an Updated Inventory:** Keep an up-to-date inventory of all third-party components used in the project.<br> **Establish Vendor Assessment Procedures:** Evaluate the security practices of third-party vendors before integration. |<br> \- Dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).<br> \- Inventory management systems.<br> \- Vendor assessment frameworks and questionnaires. |<br> **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Number of vulnerabilities identified in dependencies.<br> \- Time taken to update or patch vulnerable components.<br> \- Percentage of third-party components with known vulnerabilities.<hr> **External Metrics:**<br> \- Compliance with supply chain security requirements.<br> \- Feedback from security audits regarding third-party component management. |
| **To detect and prevent malicious commits in the codebase.** |<br> \- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all code repository accesses to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes.<br> \- **Enforce Code Signing:** Mandate that all commits are signed with verified cryptographic keys to ensure authenticity.<br> \- **Conduct Regular Audits:** Perform periodic audits of commit histories to identify and investigate suspicious activities. |<br> \- MFA tools (e.g., hardware tokens, authenticator apps).<br> \- GPG or SSH keys for commit signing.<br> \- Audit logging systems integrated with version control platforms. |<br> **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Number of unsigned or improperly signed commits detected.<br> \- Frequency of unauthorized access attempts to repositories.<br> \- Time taken to detect and respond to suspicious commit activities.<hr>**External Metrics:**<br> \- Reduction in security breaches due to compromised code.<br> \- Increased stakeholder confidence in code integrity. |
| **To secure the build and deployment infrastructure against potential threats.** |<br> \- **Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and manage infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and enable automated security checks.<br> \- **Enforce Access Controls:** Restrict access to build and deployment systems based on the principle of least privilege.<br> \- **Conduct Regular Security Assessments:** Perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on the build and deployment pipelines. |<br> \- IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).<br> \- Role-based access control (RBAC) systems.<br> \- Security assessment tools and services. |<br> \- **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated in the build pipeline.<br> \- Frequency of access control policy violations.<br> \- Time taken to deploy security patches to infrastructure.<hr> **External Metrics:**<br> \- Compliance with deployment security standards.<br> \- Reduction in incidents related to deployment infrastructure. |
| **To reduce entire classes of vulnerabilities at scale.** |<br> \- **Adopt Safer Programming Languages:** Transition to programming languages that inherently reduce certain types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Rust for memory safety).<br> \- **Mandate Secure Coding Frameworks:** Require the use of frameworks and libraries that enforce security best practices.<br> \- **Provide Developer Training:** Offer regular training sessions focused on secure coding practices and common vulnerability mitigation. |<br> \- Resources for learning and adopting safer programming languages.<br> \- Secure coding frameworks and libraries.<br> \- Training materials and programs on secure coding. |<br> **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Reduction in the number of specific vulnerability types (e.g., buffer overflows) in the codebase.<br> \- Percentage of developers who have completed security training.<br> \- Adoption rate of secure coding frameworks.<hr>**External Metrics:**<br> \- Decrease in security incidents reported by end-users.<br> \- Improved compliance with security certifications and standards. |
| **To foster a company culture conducive to securing the software supply chain.** |<br> \- **Establish Security Champions:** Designate team members as security advocates to promote best practices within development teams.<br> \- **Incentivize Secure Development:** Implement reward systems for teams that consistently adhere to security protocols.<br> \- **Encourage Open Communication:** Create channels for employees to report security concerns without fear of retribution. |<br> \- Security training programs and workshops.<br> \- Communication platforms for reporting and discussing security issues.<br> \- Recognition and reward systems for secure development practices. |<br> **Internal Metrics:**<br> \- Employee participation rates in security programs.<br> \- Number of security issues reported internally.<br> \- Frequency of security-related discussions in team meetings.<hr> **External Metrics:**<br> \- Enhanced reputation for security among clients and partners.<br> \- Reduction in security incidents originating from internal practices. |
