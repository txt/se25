# Git


## What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system used to **handle** all aspects of project development. It is commonly used by programmers to collaboratively manage and track source code.


---


## Git Data Structure
Git has two primary data structures:  


1. **Mutable Index (Stage or Cache)** – Stores information about the working directory and the next revision to be committed.  
2. **Object Database** – Stores immutable objects, including commits, trees, and blobs.  


In Git terminology:  
- A **blob** is a file, represented as a sequence of bytes.  
- A **tree** is a directory structure that maps names to blobs or other trees (allowing nested directories).

---


## Main Concepts


### **Repository**
A **repository (repo)** is a storage space containing files, directories, historical records, commits, and branches. It can be:  
- **Local** (stored on your machine)  
- **Remote** (hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)  


![Git Workflow](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT1.png)


*Image source: [Kevin T. Shoemaker - Git Tutorial](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/StatsChats/GIT_tutorial.html)*


### **Components of a Git Repository**
- **`.git` Directory** – Contains configuration files, logs, branches, HEAD, and more.  
- **Working Tree** – Represents the project's current state.  
- **Index (Staging Area)** – A middle layer between the working tree and the Git repository.  
- **HEAD** – A pointer to the latest commit in the active branch.  


---
### **Commit**
A commit is a **snapshot** of the repository at a specific moment.  
- Each commit has a unique ID (SHA-1 hash).  
- It records changes made to files (added, modified, or deleted). For example, if you added 5 files, and removed 2 others, these changes will be contained in a commit.


---


### **Branch**
A branch is a **parallel version of your project**.  
- By default, Git creates a branch called **`main`** (formerly `master`).  
- Branches enable independent feature development before merging changes.

---


### **Stages of Git**
- **Modified** – Changes have been made to a file but file has not been committed to Git Database yet.
- **Staged** – The file is marked to be included in the next commit.  
- **Committed** – Files have been committed to the Git Database. 


---


### **Merge**
Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches. It integrates the work from one branch into another.


```sh
# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <branch-name>
```

---


### **Clone**
Cloning is copying a repository from a remote server to your local machine.


```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```


---


  ### **Pull and Push**
- **Pull**: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.  
- **Push**: Sends committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.  


```sh
git pull
git push origin <branch-name>
```


---


## **Basic Commands**


```sh
#Create an empty Git repository.
git init


# Set global username and email
$ git config --global user.email "MyEmail@ncsu.com"
$ git config --global user.name "My Name"


# Quickly check available commands
$ git help


# Add files to staging area
git add <file>


# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Commit message"


# Check the status of your files. Will display the branch, untracked files, changes and other differences
git status


# List existing branches & remotes
git branch -a


# Create a new branch
git branch <new-branch>


# Delete a branch
git branch -d <branch-name>


# Rename a branch
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>


# By default, git push will push and merge changes from the current branch to its remote-tracking branch
git push


# Push commits to a remote repository
git push origin <branch-name>


# By default, git pull will update your current branch
git pull


# Create a new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>


# Switching Branches
git checkout <branch-name>


# Restoring Files to a Previous State
git checkout <branch-name> -- <file-name>


# Checking Out a Specific Commit
git checkout <commit-hash>


# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <branch-name>


#To intentionally untrack file(s) & folder(s) from git. Based on different languages, 
echo "temp/" >> .gitignore
echo "private_key" >> .gitignore
```
There are different styles of gitignore file. reference:
https://github.com/github/gitignore. For example, Python developers might
consider
using [https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore).


---


## **Special Situations**


### **Stash**
You’ve been doing some work in your git repo, but you want to pull from the remote. Since you have uncommitted changes to some files, you are not able to run git pull. Instead, you can run **`git stash`** to save your changes onto a stack!


```sh
git stash       # Save uncommitted changes
git pull        # Pull latest changes
git status      # Checking if everything is okay
git stash list  # View stashed changes
git stash pop   # Apply the latest stash and remove it from the stash list
#or
git stash apply # Apply the latest stash but keep it in the stash list
```


---


### **Fixing Merge Conflicts**
When we merge current branch to main branch, some conflicts might happen, like:
```sh
Auto-merging filename.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```


This means that Git has identified conflicting changes in "filename" that need to be resolved.<br />
Open the files with conflicts in your text editor or IDE. Conflicts sections shows your current branch, named "**HEAD**", and the branch you try to merge, named "branch-name".<br />
```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a different line on main branch.
=======
This is the modified line on current branch.
>>>>>>> feature


```


**Steps to resolve:**
1. Edit the file to resolve the conflict by choosing the right changes to keep.  
2. Stage the resolved file. Once you have resolved the conflicts, you need to stage the changes:  
   ```sh
   git add filename.txt
   ```
3. After staging the resolved files, commit the merge:  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in filename.txt"
   ```
4.  After committing, the merge conflict resolution is complete.
There are some good visual tools to help with dealing conlicts like VSCodes, IntelliJ. To minimize the chance of conflicts, pull changes from the upstream branches regularly and resolve smaller conflicts incrementally.
When working in a team, communicate about major changes or rebase regularly to reduce the chances of conflicts.

## **Reverting and Resetting Commits**


In Git, "reverse" typically refers to undoing changes or reverting a commit. There are several ways to reverse changes in Git:


### **Revert a Commit (Safe)**
Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit without rewriting history. This is useful when you want to keep the history intact and record the fact that a commit was reverted.


```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```


    But if you have merged a branch into your main branch, but later realized that you need to undo this merge. To revert a **merge commit**, specify the parent branch:


```sh
    #find the commit hash of the merge that you want to reverse
    git log --oneline
    #use "-m" option to specify the parent of the merge you want to keep. The "-m 1" option typically specifies that you want to keep the changes from the first parent (usually the main branch before the merge).
    git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```


---


### **Reset a Commit (Destructive)**


Moves the **HEAD** pointer and potentially the branch pointer to a previous commit, effectively "erasing" commits from the history. This can be destructive as it changes the commit history, making it as though certain commits never happened.


The git reset command is used to undo commits by moving the HEAD and the current branch to a specified commit. 


**Types of Reset:**
- `--soft`: Moves HEAD, but keeps changes staged.  
- `--mixed` (default):  Moves the **HEAD** to a specified commit, unstages changes (moves them to the working directory), but doesn't touch the working directory.
- `--hard`: Moves the **HEAD** to a specified commit and deletes all changes in the working directory and index.


```sh
git reset --soft <commit-hash>
git reset --mixed <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```


**⚠ Warning:** `--hard` **deletes all uncommitted changes permanently!**


---


### **Undo Changes in the Working Directory:**
Reverts changes made to files in the working directory that haven't been staged or committed yet.
If you want to undo changes to a file that haven't been staged or committed yet, you can use the "git checkout" (in older versions) or "git restore" (in newer versions) command. 
    ```sh
    git restore <file>
    #or for older version
    git checkout -- <file>
    ```


---


### **Unstage Changes:**


If you've added changes to the staging area (using "git add") and want to unstage them without losing changes in the working directory:
    ```sh
    git reset HEAD <file>
    ```
### **Reflog to Recover Lost Commits:**
If you accidentally use "git reset --hard" or otherwise lose commits, you can often recover them using the Git reflog, which tracks all movements of **HEAD**.
    ```sh
    git reflog
    ```
    Find the commit hash of the desired state, and then reset or checkout to that commit.


```sh
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

# 📌 Homework Instructions


**Note:** For the homework, we will be looking for evidence that you completed these tasks in your [commit log](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/differences-between-commit-views).


---


## Submitting Your Work
- Create a **PDF file** containing:
  1. **Your repository link**
  2. **Screenshot** for **each group member** showing **your "resolve conflicts"**(You solve conflicts if you have them. Just don't forget to document your work.) for Steps **8.**
  3. **Screenshots of your terminal** for **each group member** showing **your Git commands and terminal output** for Steps **9 - 10.**
  4. **Group number**
  5. **Names of all participants** (Name - github user id)
    
- Only **one group member** submits the work. It should contain each team member's screenshot (Steps 8-10).
- Submit the **PDF file**.


---


## 1. Initialize a New Git Repository
- Create a new directory called **`git-homework2`**.
- Initialize a **Git repository** in this directory.


  For the initial setup, pushing directly to the main is acceptable since it establishes the repository structure. After setup, all changes should follow the branch-based workflow outlined in the assignment. If your team prefers, you can use a setup branch and merge it into the main before proceeding.
  Make sure to use terminal commands as much as possible.


      
---


## 2. Create a New Project and Add It to the Repository
- Create a file called **`README.md`** and write a brief description of the repository.
- Add the following standard files to your repo:  
  - `LICENSE.md`   [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)
  - `.gitignore`  
  - `INSTALL.md` For example, you can add "Getting-Started-Installing-Git" instruction. 
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`  You can check ideas [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).
  - `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`  [Ideas](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)
  -  Check "Insights" - "[Community Standards](https://opensource.guide/)" try to go through all 'Checklist'.
(Reference: [Standard Files](https://softengbook.org/chapter2))
- Add **at least four badges** to `README.md`. All badges that connect to the service must be active ✅. No dead badges! ❌ Make sure they link correctly.
- Create a simple **webpage (`.html` file)** describing your team. Include:  
  - **Team number**  
  - **All team members' names**  
  - **Emails**
  - Add footer
.html can be "bare bone," but it should meet requirements. If you use a template, don't forget to add a source.


- Stage and commit the changes with an **appropriate commit message**.

---
All your changes need to be on GitHub. You should work with your local branch, but you will need to push it to GitHub before you merge the branches. Next, you will need to merge it with the origin/main. You will also need to fetch the changes to have an updated version locally.
---


## 8. Merge and Resolve Conflicts(Issue 5)
- Merge the **branch into the main branch**.
- Resolve conflicts by including all changes or creating a **consolidated version**.
- After resolving, **stage, commit, and complete the merge**.
- Once completed, **close the issues**.  


---


## 9. Revert a Commit
- Make a **new commit** by adding a **line to the `.html` file**.
- Undo the **most recent commit** using Git.


---


## 10. Stash Changes
- Create a **new branch** named `"temp"`.
- Make some changes but **do not commit them**.
- Use **`git stash`** to save the changes.
- Switch to the **main branch** and make another commit.
- Switch back to `"temp"` and apply the **stashed changes** using `git stash apply`.


---
**Only after all group members have completed the previous steps.**


## 11. Clean Up the Repository
- Delete all the **branches**.


---


## 🎯 Grading Scale


- Each step is worth **0.09 points**.  
- Total: **1 point**.  
- Ensure all steps are completed to receive full credit.
