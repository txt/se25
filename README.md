**About**
> About all else, SE is a team process. Teams of people you know that build your software. Teams of people you dpn't  know who will use, fix, and maintain your code.  So, its time to learn about teams, about being a team player, about being a follower and (when needed) a leader, and about creating and meeting team expectations.
